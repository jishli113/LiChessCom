# ♟️ LiChesscom — Chess.com to Lichess Game Analyzer Chrome Extension

### Seamlessly transfer your Chess.com games to Lichess for free AI-powered analysis.

---

## 📖 Overview

**LiChesscom** is a lightweight Chrome extension that bridges the gap between **Chess.com** and **Lichess.org**.  
With a single click, it automatically imports your Chess.com game into Lichess’s analysis board — letting you review positions, mistakes, and tactics using Lichess’s free and open-source analysis tools.

This project showcases modern **Chrome Extension development** using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — integrating with live browser tabs, DOM monitoring, and REST APIs for seamless automation.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. When the **“Transfer Analysis”** button is clicked:
   - The extension injects a content script into the active Chess.com tab.
   - The script observes DOM mutations to detect newly generated PGN links.
   - Once a PGN is found, it’s sent to the **Lichess import endpoint**.
   - The analyzed game opens automatically in a new tab.

2. Uses **Chrome’s Scripting API** to safely run the code in browser context.

3. All actions occur **locally** — no data storage, tracking, or account creation required.
